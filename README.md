# DataScience_TwitterSentiment

The data and python files here are for my course "Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms" on Coursera, which covers the landscape of relevant systems and techniques, with hands-on examples/practices on data analysis projects.

The goal of this assignment is to:
  - access the twitter Application Programming Interface(API) using python
  - estimate the public's perception (the sentiment) of a particular term or phrase
  - analyze the relationship between location and mood based on a sample of twitter data
  
There are 6 python files:
  - `twitterstream.py` accesses and grabs live stream of data from twitter, and stores it in an output file. You will need your own credentials to access twitter data, by going to https://dev.twitter.com/apps and obtaining `api_key`, `api_secret`, `access_token_key`, `access_token_secret` variables for this python file. Running it for three minutes should give you enough data to start with.
